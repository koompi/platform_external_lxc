This is a fork of the Linux Containers (LXC) project for PIONUX OS.

Modifications to LXC source code are kept to a bare minimum and are made with
upstreaming in mind.

Current modifications include:

    1. Addition of recursive Android.mk files to integrate with AOSP build system
    2. Addition of prebuilt files from intermediate Automake files (*.in):
        - src/config.h
        - src/lxc/version.h

For more info on LXC, please see the README and the LXC project website
https://linuxcontainers.org/lxc/.
